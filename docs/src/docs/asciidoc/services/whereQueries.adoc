If you have a more complex query then you may want to consider using the `@Where` annotation:


[source,groovy]
----
    @Where({ title ==~ pattern && releaseDate > fromDate })
    Book searchBooks(String pattern, Date fromDate)
----

With the `@Where` annotation the method name can be anything you want and query is expressed within a closure passed with the `@Where` annotation.

The query will be type checked against the parameters and compilation will fail if you misspell a parameter or property name.

The syntax is the same as what is passed to GORM's static `where` method, see the section on <<whereQueries,Where Queries>> for more information.
