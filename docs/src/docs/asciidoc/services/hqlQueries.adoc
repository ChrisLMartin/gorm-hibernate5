If you need even more flexibility, then HQL queries can be used by the `@Query` method:

[source,groovy]
----
@Query("from $Book as book where book.title like $pattern")
Book searchByTitle(String pattern)
----

Note that in the example above, if you misspell the `pattern` parameter passed to the query a compilation error will occur.

However, if you were to incorrectly input the `title` property no error would occur.

You can resolve this by declaring the value of `book` within the passed GString:

[source,groovy]
----
@Query("from ${Book book} where ${book.title} like $pattern")
Book searchByTitle(String pattern)
----

In the above example if you mispell the `title` property then a compilation error will occur.
