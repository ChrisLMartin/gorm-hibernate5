To use Hibernate 5 in Grails 3.0.x the following configuration is needed:

[source,groovy]
----
// the below is unnecessary in Grails 3.1 and above, but required in Grails 3.0.x
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
            if(details.requested.group == 'org.springframework') {
                details.useVersion('4.2.3.RELEASE')
            }
        }
    }
}

// the following is necessary in all versions of Grails 3
dependencies {
    compile "org.grails.plugins:hibernate5:$gormVersion"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-core:5.1.0.Final"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-ehcache:5.1.0.Final"
}
----

The `resolutionStrategy` is needed to enforce an upgrade to Spring 4.2.x which is required by Hibernate 5 support. This block is not needed if you are using Grails 3.1 or above.
