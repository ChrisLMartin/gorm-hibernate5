GORM supports the concept of *dynamic finders*. A dynamic finder looks like a static method invocation, but the methods themselves don't actually exist in any form at the code level.

Instead, a method is auto-magically generated using code synthesis at runtime, based on the properties of a given class. Take for example the `Book` class:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    Author author
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Author {
    String name
}
----

The `Book` class has properties such as `title`, `releaseDate` and `author`. These can be used by the `findBy*` and `findAllBy*` methods in the form of "method expressions":

[source,groovy]
----
def book = Book.findByTitle("The Stand")

book = Book.findByTitleLike("Harry Pot%")

book = Book.findByReleaseDateBetween(firstDate, secondDate)

book = Book.findByReleaseDateGreaterThan(someDate)

book = Book.findByTitleLikeOrReleaseDateLessThan("%Something%", someDate)
----

==== Method Expressions

A method expression in GORM is made up of the prefix such as `findBy*` followed by an expression that combines one or more properties. The basic form is:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.findBy(<<Property>><<Comparator>><<Boolean Operator>>)?<<Property>><<Comparator>>
----

The tokens marked with a '?' are optional. Each comparator changes the nature of the query. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def book = Book.findByTitle("The Stand")

book =  Book.findByTitleLike("Harry Pot%")
----

In the above example the first query is equivalent to equality whilst the latter, due to the `Like` comparator, is equivalent to a SQL `like` expression.

The possible comparators include:

* `InList` - In the list of given values
* `LessThan` - less than a given value
* `LessThanEquals` - less than or equal a give value
* `GreaterThan` - greater than a given value
* `GreaterThanEquals` - greater than or equal a given value
* `Like` - Equivalent to a SQL like expression
* `Ilike` - Similar to a `Like`, except case insensitive
* `NotEqual` - Negates equality
* `InRange` - Between the `from` and `to` values of a Groovy Range
* `Rlike` - Performs a Regexp LIKE in MySQL or Oracle otherwise falls back to `Like`
* `Between` - Between two values (requires two arguments)
* `IsNotNull` - Not a null value (doesn't take an argument)
* `IsNull` - Is a null value (doesn't take an argument)

Notice that the last three require different numbers of method arguments compared to the rest, as demonstrated in the following example:

[source,groovy]
----
def now = new Date()
def lastWeek = now - 7
def book = Book.findByReleaseDateBetween(lastWeek, now)

books = Book.findAllByReleaseDateIsNull()
books = Book.findAllByReleaseDateIsNotNull()
----

==== Boolean logic (AND/OR)

Method expressions can also use a boolean operator to combine two or more criteria:

[source,groovy]
----
def books = Book.findAllByTitleLikeAndReleaseDateGreaterThan(
                      "%Java%", new Date() - 30)
----

In this case we're using `And` in the middle of the query to make sure both conditions are satisfied, but you could equally use `Or`:

[source,groovy]
----
def books = Book.findAllByTitleLikeOrReleaseDateGreaterThan(
                      "%Java%", new Date() - 30)
----

You can combine as many criteria as you like, but they must all be combined with `And` or all `Or`. If you need to combine `And` and `Or` or if the number of criteria creates a very long method name, just convert the query to a <<criteria,Criteria>> or <<hql,HQL>> query.


==== Querying Associations


Associations can also be used within queries:

[source,groovy]
----
def author = Author.findByName("Stephen King")

def books = author ? Book.findAllByAuthor(author) : []
----

In this case if the `Author` instance is not null we use it in a query to obtain all the `Book` instances for the given `Author`.


==== Pagination and Sorting


The same pagination and sorting parameters available on the link:../api/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormEntity.html#list()[list()] method can also be used with dynamic finders by supplying a map as the final parameter:

[source,groovy]
----
def books = Book.findAllByTitleLike("Harry Pot%",
               [max: 3, offset: 2, sort: "title", order: "desc"])
----
