Schema-per-tenant is when a single database is used, but a different database schema is used for each tenant.

Currently GORM for Hibernate, does not have support for the schema-based approach. However, this approach is implemented in http://gorm.grails.org/latest/mongodb/manual/index.html[GORM for MongoDB].

Support for schema-per-tenant is planned for a future version of GORM for Hibernate.
