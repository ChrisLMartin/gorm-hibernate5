Multitenancy, as it relates to software developments, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenants data is isolated from the other.

This type of architecture is highly common in Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud based architectures. There are a variety of approaches to multitenancy and GORM tries to be flexible in supporting as many as possible.
