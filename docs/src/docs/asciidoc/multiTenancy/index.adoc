Multi-Tenancy, as it relates to software developments, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenants' data is isolated from the other.

This type of architecture is highly common in Software as a Service (SaaS) and Cloud architectures. There are a variety of approaches to multi-tenancy and GORM tries to be flexible in supporting as many as possible.
