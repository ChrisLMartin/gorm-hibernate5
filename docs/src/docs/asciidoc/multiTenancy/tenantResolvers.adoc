As mentioned previously the link:../api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/TenantResolver.html[TenantResolver] interface is how you define the value of the link:../api/grails/gorm/multitenancy/Tenants.html#currentId()[current tenant].

This section will cover a few more details about implementing `TenantResolver` instances.

==== Specifying the Tenant Resolver

As already mentioned you can specify the `TenantResolver` via configuration using the `grails.gorm.tenantResolverClass` setting:

[source,yaml]
----
grails:
    gorm:
        multiTenancy:
            mode: DATABASE
            tenantResolverClass: org.grails.datastore.mapping.multitenancy.web.SubDomainTenantResolver
----

However, if you are using Grails or Spring Boot then the `TenantResolver` can also be specified as a Spring bean and it will automatically be injected, this allows you to use dependency injection to configure the dependencies of the resolver.

==== Built in Tenant Resolvers

The following table contains all of the `TenantResolver` implementations that ship with GORM and are usable out of the box. The package name has been shorted from `org.grails.datastore.mapping` to `o.g.d.m` for brevity:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
name,description
`o.g.d.m.multitenancy.resolvers.FixedTenantResolver`, Resolves against a fixed tenant id
`o.g.d.m.multitenancy.resolvers.SystemPropertyTenantResolver`, Resolves the tenant id from a system property called `gorm.tenantId`
`o.g.d.m.multitenancy.web.SubDomainTenantResolver`, Resolves the tenant id from the subdomain via DNS
`o.g.d.m.multitenancy.web.CookieTenantResolver`, Resolves the current tenant from an HTTP cookie named `gorm.tenantId` by default
`o.g.d.m.multitenancy.web.SessionTenantResolver`, Resolves the current tenant from the HTTP session using the attribute `gorm.tenantId` by default
|===

The tenant resolvers in the `org.grails.datastore.mapping.multitenancy.web` package require the `grails-datastore-web` dependency:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
compile "org.grails:grails-datastore-web:{version}"
----

==== Implementing Web Tenant Resolvers

If you wish to implement your own tenant resolver for Grails or Spring Boot then it is possible do so using the `RequestContextHolder` class without needing to inject any dependencies. For example the `SubDomainTenantResolver` implementation is as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
Serializable resolveTenantIdentifier() {

    RequestAttributes requestAttributes = RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes()
    if(requestAttributes instanceof ServletWebRequest) {

        String subdomain = ((ServletWebRequest)requestAttributes).getRequest().getRequestURL().toString();
        subdomain = subdomain.substring(subdomain.indexOf("/") + 2);
        if( subdomain.indexOf(".") > -1 ) {
            return subdomain.substring(0, subdomain.indexOf("."))
        }
        else {
            return ConnectionSource.DEFAULT
        }
    }
    throw new TenantNotFoundException("Tenant could not be resolved outside a web request")
}
----

NOTE: If the tenant id is not found a `TenantNotFoundException` should be thrown.
