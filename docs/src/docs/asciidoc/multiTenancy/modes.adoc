GORM supports the following different multi tenancy modes:

* `DATABASE` - A separate database with a separate connection pool is used to store each tenants data.
* `SCHEMA` - The same database, but different schemas are used to store each tenants data.
* `DISCRIMINATOR` - The same database is used with a discriminator used to partition and isolate data.

The above modes are listed from least probable to leak data between tenants to most probable. When using a `DISCRIMINATOR` approach much greater case needs to be taken to ensure tenants don't see each other's data.
