To configure multiple data sources you need to use the `dataSources` setting. For example in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
dataSource:
    pooled: true
    dbCreate: create-drop
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:books
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password:
dataSources:
    moreBooks:
        url: jdbc:h2:mem:moreBooks
        hibernate:
            readOnly: true
    evenMoreBooks:
        url: jdbc:h2:mem:evenMoreBooks
----

You can configure individual settings for each data source. If a setting is not specified by default the setting is inherited from the default data source, so in the example above there is no need to specify the `driverClassName` for each data source if the same driver is used for all.

TIP: For more information on configuration see the <<configuration,Configuration section>>.
